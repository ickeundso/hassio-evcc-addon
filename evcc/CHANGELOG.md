# Changelog

## 0.303.2-feature

- Fix: Min+PV mode now respects bufferSoc — stops draining house battery when SOC drops below threshold
- When bufferSoc is configured and battery is below it, Min+PV falls through to PV surplus logic instead of unconditionally charging at minimum current
- No change in behavior when bufferSoc is not configured (original Min+PV behavior preserved)
